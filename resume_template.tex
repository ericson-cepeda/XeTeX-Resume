% Okay, notes... 
% So this whole thing is a hack I put together while I was learning LaTeX, so I know it sucks.
% The doc's margins are set a few lines down from here, on that one that says \usepackage...{geometry}.
% Aside from that, I set \leftskip to be 4em, which is what makes almost all the text moved over.
% The \heading and \subheading items reduce the \leftskip by 4em and 2em, respectively. 
% For those of you who paid attention in math class, this means \heading is "indented" 0em,
% \subhead 2em, and everything else 4em

% NOTABLE HACKS
% Okay, to get the tabular to line up properly, I tweaked the \leftskip some more until the table lined up.
% And to get the drop-indent effect on 'Other Work Experience' I used a \parindent of -2em.
% Actually, that may be the legit way to do that. I dunno. You find out and let me know.
% Oh, yeah, I used a ton of \vspace{}s because, damn. Gotta have that whitespace. Stack them tabs.

% SUPERBIG HACK
% The \heading command is FUBAR because of the way LaTeX does optional parameters.
% You can give the heading text to be put in big bold letters, and some other text 
% to be put in italics ON THE SAME LINE, which is handy if you're me.
% Usage: \heading[italicised text]{Bolded text}
% Result: <b>Bolded Text</b> <i>italicised text</i>
% Notice how the arguments are reversed? Fuckin' rad. LaTeX should have my babies. Get me out of here.
% By the same token:
% Usage: \subhead{Bolded text}
% If you need a Result: for this one, go back to Digg (oh zing!). Actually, I couldn't care less about the whole Digg vs Reddit thing, but it's like making fun of skaters or emo kids about who came first. Save your wrists, cut your hair.
