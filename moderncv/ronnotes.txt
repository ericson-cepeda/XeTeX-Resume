Ron Minnich has been working in HPC for much longer than he ever expected to, which explains the grey hairs in his beard. He has built software and HPC systems based on FPGAs, PIMs, distributed computers (co-authoring a famous C&W song: "I was Grid before Grid was cool"), and clusters. He has been working with Unix innards longer than some of his co-workers have been alive, which fact causes him to wonder if he should get in another line of work.
